    "\n",
    "Ans: Eigenvalues and eigenvectors are mathematical concepts used in linear algebra. In the PCA eigenvector context, they represent the data's variance. The eigen-decomposition approach is a technique used to decompose a matrix into its eigenvectors and eigenvalues."

    "2. What is eigen decomposition and what is its significance in linear algebra?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans: Eigen decomposition is used to compute the principal components of the data by finding the eigenvectors and eigenvalues of the covariance matrix of the data. The eigenvectors represent the direction of maximum variance in the data, and the corresponding eigenvalues indicate the amount of variance along each eigenvector direction."

    "\n",
    "Ans: The significance of the spectral theorem in PCA is that it ensures that the covariance matrix used in PCA is symmetric, which means that it can be diagonalized using Eigen-Decomposition. This diagonalization results in the identification of the principal components of the data, which can be used for dimensionality reduction."

    "\n",
    "Ans: To find the eigenvalues of a matrix, we need to solve the characteristic equation (det(A-λI) = 0), where A is the matrix, λ is an unknown scalar (the eigenvalue), and I is the identity matrix."

    "\n",
    "Ans: Eigenvectors are non-zero vectors that, when multiplied by a matrix, result in a scalar multiple of themselves. Eigenvalues and eigenvectors are closely related and are typically found using the Eigen-Decomposition approach."

    "\n",
    "Ans: Geometrically, the eigenvectors of a matrix represent the directions in which the matrix stretches or shrinks space. The eigenvalues represent the factor by which the matrix stretches or shrinks space along those eigenvectors. By decomposing a matrix into its eigenvectors and eigenvalues, we can better understand its behavior and properties."

    "b. Graph Laplacian Eigenmaps: This technique uses the Eigen-Decomposition of the Laplacian matrix of a graph to embed the graph in a lower-dimensional space. This technique is often used for tasks such as clustering and visualization of high-dimensional data and has applications in fields such as computer vision and social network analysis.\n",

By identifying the Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors of the covariance matrix of the data, PCA can transform high-dimensional data into a lower-dimensional space while preserving the essential information."
